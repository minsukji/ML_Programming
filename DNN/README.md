This repository contains files for machine learning (training and prediction) for binary classification task via Deep Neural Network. Front end (loading and processing train/test data) is in Python. Backend (training and prediction engines) is in 1) Pythonusing Numpy, 2) CPP using Eigen, and 3) CPP using CUDA (GPGPU). Python-CPP integration is done using Pybind11. This work is motivated by the Deep Learning Specialization courses I took at Coursera.
